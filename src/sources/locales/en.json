For example, when moderators are unavailable,\n\t\t\t\t\tmessages that receive enough reports will be subject to automated moderation.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis also allows our moderators to take a less proactive role and instead focus on messages that have been flagged by the community.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe expect to release this system within the next week or two.\n\t\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t\tLastly, a reminder to follow our rules regarding the single-account policy and trade boosting.\n\t\t\t\t\tWith many new players joining, some may not be familiar with our stance on funenlng wealth from alt accounts or coin purchases from gold sellers.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe regularly conduct ban waves. For example, over the past couple of weeks,\n\t\t\t\t\twe've issued temporary or permanent bans to 500+ main accounts and thousands of alt accounts.\n\t\t\t\t\tPlayers receiving temp bans also had 2–3x the boosted wealth removed, totaling over 100 billion coins.\n\t\t\t\t\tCheating is not worth the risk, and we will continue to improve our detection systems.\n\t\t\t\t</div>"
